	/// Perform an operation on a Promise once it resolves. The chain will then resolve to the Promise returned from the handler.
	/// This `.then()` is used to chain a Promise with another Promise. So, for example, you can do this:
	/// `self.asyncFunc1.then(self.asyncFunc2)`
	/// the result of the first promise is passed as first argument to the second chained promise and the output is the
	/// type of the second promise.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - context: context in which the `fulfillEndHandler` is called (that's not the context in which the second Promise is called)
	///   - fulfillEndHandler: this is the handler executed when the first promise (left side) is resolved. You can return
	///     another promise to chain or your code which end up with a promise to chain.
	/// - Returns: a new Promise with the new value defined by right side Promise

			// We want to get notified when a Promise ends up with a fullfill or a rejection

			// second promise; otherwise if its ends rejected we simply forward to rejection function.
