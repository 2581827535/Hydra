	/// - Parameters:
	///   - context: context queue to reject on (if not specified `main` queue is used instead)
	///   - seconds: timeout interval (after passed interval promise will be rejected)
	///   - error: optional; if non-nil value is passed Promise will be rejected with passed error; otherwise `.timeout` is used instead.
	/// - Returns: Promise
